# Python Basic Tasks & Solutions  

## 1. Python Simple Calculator  
Build a basic calculator that takes two numbers and an operator as input, then performs the chosen operation.
These is used to calculate a simple mathematical calculations like addition,subtraction,nultiplication and division.
Their is an example that if we wanted to calculate addition then we have to enter choice as 1 and then we have to give numbers like 23 and 45 then we get the result as 68.

## 2. Python Guess The Number

Generate a random number and ask the user to guess it. Give hints if the guess is too high or too lt  
 This is a game that based on numbers.In this a number is given randomly between the range 0-50.   
 we have to guess the random number.     
 we have five chances of guessing the correct random number.so, if we guess the random number might be  greater than or lower than the random value.if we guess lower number then it shows "your guess number is lower",and if we guess a number that greater than the random number then it shows "your guess number is higher".   
 If our five guesses are incorrect then it shows us as"sorry you have entered a wrong guess",and it shows the random number as the result.
